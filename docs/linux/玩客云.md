### 一、刷机

>刷机包: https://github.com/hzyitc/armbian-onecloud/releases

>刷机成功之后按照引导进入系统即可。

### 二、配置静态IP和DNS

执行命令: `vim /etc/netplan/10-dhcp-all-interfaces.yam`

编辑内容为(注释掉eth借口的相关配置):

```yaml
# Added by Armbian
#
# Reference: https://netplan.readthedocs.io/en/stable/netplan-yaml/
#
# Let systemd-networkd manage all Ethernet devices on this system, but be configured by Netplan.

network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    #all-eth-interfaces:
    #  match:
    #    name: "e*"
    #  dhcp4: yes
    #  dhcp6: yes
    #  ipv6-privacy: yes # Enabled by default on most current systems, but networkd currently doesn't enable IPv6 privacy by default, see https://man.archlinux.org/man/systemd.network.5
    all-lan-interfaces: # include interfaces that are renamed to 'lanX' by udev, e.g. nanopi-r2s
      match:
        name: "lan[0-9]*"
      dhcp4: yes
      dhcp6: yes
      ipv6-privacy: yes # Enabled by default on most current systems, but networkd currently doesn't enable IPv6 privacy by default, see https://man.archlinux.org/man/systemd.network.5
    all-wan-interfaces: # include interfaces that are renamed to 'wanX' by udev, e.g. nanopi-r1
      match:
        name: "wan[0-9]*"
      dhcp4: yes
      dhcp6: yes
      ipv6-privacy: yes # Enabled by default on most current systems, but networkd currently doesn't enable IPv6 privacy by default, see https://man.archlinux.org/man/systemd.network.5
```

执行命令: `vim /etc/netplan/20-eth-fixed-mac.yaml`

编辑内容为:

```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    eth0:
      dhcp4: no
      dhcp6: no
      addresses: [192.168.2.2/24]
      routes:
        - to: default
          via: 192.168.2.1
      nameservers:
        addresses: [223.5.5.5, 223.6.6.6]
      macaddress: 00:22:6D:50:42:A9
```
